DETAILS

1.0 Background:

zGlue, Inc. developed a simple chiplet model for use in zGlue's Chipbuilder software. We are promoting this chiplet model for wider usage through open initiatives. We are now collectively releasing the zGlue Chiplet Info Exchange Format (ZEF) as a formal open source specification to help the industry. The idea is that with a standard machine-readable description of Chiplets, it will help automate design and business processes across companies when it comes to chiplet based business ecosystem. The spirit of this disclosure is to encourage openness in an otherwise closed-source industry of chip design. zGlue Inc is releasing this information under ZEF license, which is adapted from the GPL v3 license. ZEF License is a free, copyleft license related to the description and implementation of an open file format (ZEF) to help standardize data exchange related to chiplets. While others are free to use and build upon this format, we request that all subsequent improvements and variations give attribution to zGlue, Inc's original contribution in starting this effort.  We also request that the name of this spec be kept ZEF and the file extensions are kept to be ``.zef". 


What is included in this Repository:
-ZEF Specification (this file)
-ZEF Copyleft License (ZEF License v. 1.0)

2.0 File Formats:

ZEF contains a set of files.  The file name will follow the format of <MPN>_<TYPE>.zef.  MPN stands for Manufacturer's Part Number which is a unique product identifier.  TYPE include from {mech, io, elect} but not limited and additional types can be defined.  The filename format should, however, should be followed.

For example, for a hypothetical chiplet ZGL12345FC, the set of ZEF files include ZGL12345FC_mech.zef, ZGL12345FC_io.zef, ZGL12345FC_elect.zef and so forth.

Each of these files will be an ASCII Text file that structurally looks like a comma separated variable (CSV) format.  Any kind of encryption of these files should be handled at a higher level.



3.0 ZEF Parameter Specification:

ZEF parameters are broken into three types, a) mechanical, b) io, c) electrical.  These parameters define the interfaces and outside characteristics of these chiplets.  Most of this information can be found in datasheets.


3.1 ZEF Mechanical (Mech) Parameters


Parameter Name = "Reference", units = N/A, Description = This parameter is reserved as a designator for the Chiplet in the chiplet library. This field will be left blank for a single chiplet but will be useful as an identifier in a library.

Parameter Name = "MPN", units = N/A, Description = Manufacturer's part number. Refer to unique SKU and ordering information.

Parameter Name = "SMT_compatible", units = Boolean, Description = A predicate that tells the reader whether this part is compatible with SMT or not.  Valid values are 0 or 1.  For most of the chiplets, this field will be set to 1.

Parameter Name = "Width_x_typ", units = microns, Description = Chiplet width typical value.

Parameter Name = "Width_x_tolerance", units = microns, Description = Chiplet width tolerance. Typically listed as a plus/minus value in the datasheet.

Parameter Name = "Width_x_min", units = microns, Description =Chiplet width minimum value.  This can also be calculated as a typical value minus the relevant tolerance.

Parameter Name = "Width_x_max", units = microns, Description =Chiplet width maximum value.  This can also be calculated as a typical value plus the relevant tolerance.

Parameter Name = "Length_y_typ", units = microns, Description = Chiplet length typical value.

Parameter Name = "Length_y_tolerance", units = microns, Description = Chiplet length tolerance. Typically listed as a plus minus value in the datasheet.

Parameter Name = "Thickness_z_tolerance", units = microns, Description = Chiplet Thickness tolerance. Typically listed as a plus/minus value in the datasheet.

Parameter Name = "Thickness_z_min", units = microns, Description =Chiplet Thickness minimum value.  This can also be calculated as a typical value minus the relevant tolerance.
