## Background:

zGlue, Inc. developed a simple chiplet model for use in zGlue's Chipbuilder software. We are promoting this chiplet model for wider usage through open initiatives. We are now collectively releasing the zGlue Chiplet Info Exchange Format (ZEF) as a formal open source specification to help the industry. The idea is that with a standard machine-readable description of Chiplets, it will help automate design and business processes across companies when it comes to chiplet based business ecosystem. The spirit of this disclosure is to encourage openness in an otherwise closed-source industry of chip design. zGlue Inc is releasing this information under ZEF license, which is adapted from the GPL v3 license. ZEF License is a free, copyleft license related to the description and implementation of an open file format (ZEF) to help standardize data exchange related to chiplets. While others are free to use and build upon this format, we request that all subsequent improvements and variations give attribution to zGlue, Inc's original contribution in starting this effort.  We also request that the name of this spec be kept ZEF and the file extensions are kept to be ".zef".
