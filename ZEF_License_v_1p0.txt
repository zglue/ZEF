zGlue Chiplet information Exchange Format License
Version 1.0, May 15, 2019
Copyright © 2019 zGlue Inc. <https://zglue.com>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The zGlue chiplet information Exchange Format (“ZEF”) License is a free, copyleft license related to the description and implementation of an open file format (the zGlue chiplet information Exchange Format) to help the industry.  The implementation of files following this open format (“ZEF files”) may help automate chiplet-based design and associated business processes across the industry, and may thereby help develop the marketplace for chiplets. 
The ZEF License has been adapted from the GNU General Public License (GPL), Version 3.  While the GNU GPL has been developed as a copyleft license to encourage the propagation of software, the ZEF License has been developed as a copyleft license to encourage the propagation of open-format ZEF files.  As such, the ZEF License differs in various ways from the GNU GPL.
In comparison with the GNU GPL, the ZEF License does not pertain to source code, and as a result does not have sections related to “Source Code” and “Conveying Non-Source Forms.”  Instead, the ZEF License is directed toward the development and use of ZEF files, by instituting an open file format, while protecting the ability of users to privately circulate specific ZEF files (as users may wish to do for ZEF files containing information that may not be suitable for public release).
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification of various files associated with the ZEF License follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.
“This License” and “the ZEF License” refer to version 1.0 of the zGlue ZEF copyleft license.
 “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
“The Source Files” include the ZEF Specification, the ZEF Readme file, [and] Example ZEF files (such as Input/Output (“IO”) files, mechanical (“mech”) files, and electrical (“elec”) files), and the ZEF License.  “The Source Files” includes the ZEF Specification and ZEF Readme file.
A “covered work” means (1) the ZEF Specification, (2) the ZEF Readme file, (3) the unmodified Example ZEF files, or (4) ZEF file(s) that are based on the Example ZEF files, the Source Files, or both.
To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy (including ZEF files based on the Example ZEF files, the Source Files, or both). The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.  
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Basic Permissions.
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Source Files, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
You may make and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 8 makes it unnecessary.

2. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

3. Conveying Verbatim Copies of Source Files.
You may convey verbatim copies of the Source Files as you receive them, in any medium, provided that you keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 5 apply to any covered works distributed along with the Source Files; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Source Files.
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee, so long as you comply with the basic permissions and conditions of this License.

4. Conveying Covered Works, Attribution, and File Extension.
You may convey a covered work provided that you meet all of these conditions:
•   a) The work must be accompanied by prominent notices stating any modifications that you made, and giving a relevant date.
•   b) The work must be accompanied by prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 5. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 3 to “keep intact all notices”.
•   c) The work must be accompanied by an attribution (as discussed below).
•   d) The names of any ZEF files in the work must use “.zef” as the file extension.

This License gives no permission to license the covered work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
An accompanying attribution may be an attribution in the ZEF Specification, the ZEF Readme file, or both.  An accompanying attribution should indicate the originator of the file format (here, zGlue Inc.), and should include at least name, address, and website identification information.  An exemplary attribution would be: “This file, and its accompanying files, pertain to the ZEF file format developed by zGlue Inc., 883 N. Shoreline Blvd., Suite C200, Mountain View, CA 94043, <https://zglue.com>.”

5. Additional Terms.
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to covered works shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to some covered works, those covered works may be used separately under those permissions, but the Source Files remain governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
•		a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 12 and 13 of this License; or
•		c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
•		d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
•		e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
•		f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 8. If the covered work as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may not remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

6. Termination.
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 9).
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 8.

7. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive a copy of the Source Files. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

8. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors to modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. 
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Source Files or any portion of them.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

9. Patents. 
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of covered works. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work.

10. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. 

11. Revised Versions of this License.
zGlue Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the ZEF License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Source Files specify that a certain numbered version of the ZEF License “or any later version” applies to them, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by zGlue Incorporated. If the Source Files do not specify a version number of the ZEF License, you may choose any version ever published by zGlue incorporated.
If the Source Files specify that a proxy can decide which future versions of the ZEF License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Source Files.
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOURCE FILES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE SOURCE FILES “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOURCE FILES IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOURCE FILES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

13. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE SOURCE FILIES AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOURCE FILES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE SOURCE FILES TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

14. Interpretation of Sections 12 and 13.
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Source Files, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Source Files in return for a fee.
